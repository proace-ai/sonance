## üèÜ Hackathon Submission

This project was created for the Frontend UI Hackathon 2025 #2, showcasing advanced UI/UX techniques and integration of modern technologies in web development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Then edit `.env.local` with your configuration
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üì¶ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy this app is using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Set your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

### Docker Deployment

This app can be deployed using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t sonance-app .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -e NODE_ENV=production sonance-app
   ```

### Self-Hosting

1. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app is configured for production with:

- Standalone output mode for easy deployment
- Image optimization and caching
- Gzip compression
- Security headers

## üè≠ Production Readiness

Before deploying to production, follow these steps for optimal performance and stability:

### Image Optimization

- Use the `OptimizedImage` component for all images (src/app/components/common/OptimizedImage.tsx)
- Verify all `<img>` tags have been replaced with Next.js `<Image>` components
- Check next.config.js for proper image domain configurations

### Code Quality

- Fix React Hook dependency warnings (see scripts/prod-ready.js for checklist)
- Address all TypeScript errors (temporarily disabled in next.config.js)
- Replace JavaScript-style comments in JSX with proper JSX comments
- Use proper JSX escaping for apostrophes and quotes: &apos; &quot;

### Performance

- Enable production build optimizations:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- Check Lighthouse scores and address any issues
- Review bundle size and implement code-splitting where necessary
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components

### Security

- Remove temporary configuration options from next.config.js:
  ```js
  // Remove these once issues are fixed
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  }
  ```
- Add Content-Security-Policy headers
- Implement proper error handling

### Testing

- Run thorough testing across different devices and browsers
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility
- Verify all user flows work as expected

For a complete production readiness checklist, see `scripts/prod-ready.js`.
